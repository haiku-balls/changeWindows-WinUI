# Change Windows (WinUI)

## ❓What?
This program tracks your windows installs. Similar to the built in one from Windows Update, but it logs more information about it. (Such as what insider channel it came from or its full build tag)
This program is catered towards Windows Insiders who install builds very often. 

## ⁉️Why?
As an Insider since '19, I always disliked that there isn't any log that gives me lots of info about the builds I've flighted in the past. I created this program mainly for myself (and others) who share the same grievances. The Windows Update log is rather lackluster as it only tells you what build it was and the date.
